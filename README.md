<p>
This project shows how semantic caching can make LLM applications faster and cheaper by smartly reusing previous question–answer pairs.

You’ll find practical tutorials that walk you through how semantic caching and reranking work, plus a dashboard that helps you experiment and find the best caching strategy for your own data.

The project also includes a RAG chatbot with semantic caching built in, so you can try it out yourself and clearly see the difference it makes.
